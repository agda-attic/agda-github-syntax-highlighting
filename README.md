Syntax highlighting for Agda
============================

This repository contains (rudimentary) syntax highlighting for Agda, for use on GitHub.

The `Agda.tmLanguage` grammar file (which is the one used by GitHub) is generated automatically from
`Agda.yml` using the script
[https://github.com/asciidoctor/sublimetext-asciidoc/blob/master/script/yaml-to-plist].
